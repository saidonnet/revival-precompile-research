# Revival: Precompile & Stateless Research for EVM State Bloat

> **Status:** Active research & reference implementation | **Seeking funding and collaborators**

## Executive Summary

Unbounded blockchain state threatens decentralization, validator viability, and network health for EVM-compatible chains. This repo presents a **full technical specification and reference implementation** to address state bloat on Ethereum-like PoS chains. It covers state lifecycle (expiry, revival), stateless execution (witnesses), advanced commitments (Verkle, IPA, KZG), decentralized archival, migration playbook, and security analysis — all backed by a 600-agent R&D harness.

## Why This Matters

- **State bloat** prices out individual validators and increases centralization risks.
- **Stateless execution** and compact proofs enable lightweight nodes and better scalability.
- **Archival layer** ensures history remains verifiable, auditable, and accessible.

## Repo Contents

- `WHITEPAPER.md` or `whitepaper.pdf` — Full technical paper (theory, design, code, migration, security)
- `rust/` — Verkle trees, witness generation/verification (Rust)
- `solidity/` — Revival precompile, contract helpers (Solidity)
- `agents/` — Multi-agent harness (600 agents, reproducible experiments)
- `benchmarks/` — Raw data, analysis scripts
- `docs/` — Migration playbook, security audit

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install prerequisites
# Rust, Node.js, Docker recommended

# Run all Rust tests
cargo test --all

# Run the multi-agent experiment (adjust for your setup)
docker-compose -f agents/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Benchmark
./scripts/run-benchmarks.sh
```
